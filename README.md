# Hierarchical model to screen quaternary BCC refractory alloys

Data is part of the following publication: Sundar, A., Ferron, D.B., Hu, YJ. et al. Automated hierarchical screening of refractory multicomponent alloys with high intrinsic ductility and surface passivation potency. MRS Communications (2022). [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1557/s43579-022-00241-1)

This repository is used to build a dashboard, which contains 1184 alloys screend using our workflow. The dashboard can be used to visulize: 1) CALPHAD-based alloy phase diagrams for 1184 alloys and 2) DFT and CALPHAD validation results for 10 representative alloys.

The app can be launched locally by 'python3.10 index.py'

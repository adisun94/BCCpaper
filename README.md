# Hierarchical model to screen quaternary BCC refractory alloys

Paper currently under review.
This repository is used to build a dashboard, which contains 1184 alloys screend using our workflow. The dashboard can be used to visulize: 1) CALPHAD-based alloy phase diagrams for 1184 alloys and 2) DFT and CALPHAD validation results for 10 representative alloys.

Distribution of target properties for the 133 alloys.  (a) Alloy supercells generated by the SQS method[10] for DFT calculations to construct the dataset. The colors denote different types of chemical elements. Left subfigure: a representative bulk supercell with 6 (110 ¯ ) planes (separated by Interface 1–6 plotted in dashed lines); center subfigure: a supercell for the γsurf calculation generated by cutting the bulk supercell along Interface 1; right subfigure: a supercell for the γ<sub>usf</sub> calculation generated by displacing the atoms above Interface 1 in the bulk supercell along 0.5[111] on (110 ¯ ) plane. The basis vector along [110 ¯ ] of the supercell is titled by 0.5[111] to make sure there is only one USF in this supercell. (b) γ<sub>usf</sub> vs. the averaged valence electron count (VEC) for all alloys in the DFT-based dataset. (c) D vs. the averaged VEC for all alloys in the DFT-based dataset. In (b) and (c), the blue and red circles correspond to alloys that include only d-block transition elements (Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re, Ru, Cr). Green stars denote alloys including Al or Si. Part of the data was obtained from a previous publication by Hu et al.VEC is the composition averaged 'valence electron count'.
